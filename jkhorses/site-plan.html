        A farrier provides two key functions when he provides care.  First, he helps to maintain the integrity and health of the structural components of your horses’ feet, including the hoof wall, sole and frog.  Second, he ensures that the feet remain in proper balance.  Balance is the primary concern and objective when trimming and shoeing a horse.  As a horse matures it is necessary to trim the hooves regularly and consistently for the animal to remain sound.  The correct angle comes from the correct toe and heel length.  Every horse is different, some grow more heel and some more toe.  Having a qualified horse care specialist is necessary for the horse’s health and longevity, hoof, and leg soundness.  All horses need regular hoof care, but not all horses require shoeing.

        What is teeth floating and why is it important for your horse’s health?  Floating teeth is when an equine dentist goes through the process of removing sharp points from horse’s teeth.  What this does is make an even grinding pattern for chewing.  As a horse matures, they develop these points on their teeth.  It often causes pain as those sharp points start to poke into their cheeks and gums.  As the pain gets worse the horse will start to lose their appetite and drop food from their mount. These points can become razor like and result in cuts on the inside of the mouth.   Here are few signs to look for that could mean your horse is ready for a visit from the dentist.  
        o	Dropping feed from the mouth while chewing
        o	Drooling while eating
        o	Weight loss 
        o	Resistance with the bit or signs that the bit is uncomfortable
        o	Cribbing 
        o	Quidding (packing feed between the teeth and cheek
        o	Sharp points on their teeth
