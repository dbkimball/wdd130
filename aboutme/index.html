        Hello Everyone, let me introduce myself. I am married and we have two beautiful daughters and one granddaughter.  Some of my hobbies include spending time with my family, reading, movies, hiking and all things outdoors.  I am an animal lover.  We have many horses, several donkeys, a couple goats, a couple dogs and a few barn cats. Donkeys seem to be my favorite these days, we have two regular size donkeys named Tom & Jerry and a mini donkey named Pickles. He's my favorite. I'm a native of Arizona and will probably always be here.  Even though I love to see new places, Arizona has my heart.

        I have been working in the technical support industry for the last 18 years and recently decided to go back to school and finally get my degree. One of the reasons I went back to school at such a late stage in life is because I never finished college.  After our youngest graduated Highschool and started college herself I felt prompted that it was time for me too.  I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Applied Technology with an emphasis in web development.  I have always loved to learn and am so blessed that BYU Idaho offers so many courses through online learning.  I'm looking forward to learning more about building websites and growing with all of you throughout this semester.

        I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints all my life.  I served a mission in Samara, Russia. I am so thankful for the opportunities I have had to share the gospel with others and I cherish my experience as a missionary. I love to learn about our Savior and I'm trying every day to be like Him.
